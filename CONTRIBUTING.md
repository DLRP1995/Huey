## Contribution Guidelines
To maintain the quality and consistency of the project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Coding Standards:**
  - Follow Python PEP8 standards for coding.
  - Ensure your code is well-documented and includes comments where necessary.
  - When working with Docker, Kubernetes, or Debian-related optimizations, ensure your configurations follow the project standards for containerization and cloud scaling.

- **Commit Messages:**
  - Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages.
  - Use imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
  - Use tags for categorization, e.g., `[Fix]`, `[Feature]`, `[Docs]` to make it clear what your commit covers.

- **Testing:**
  - Ensure your code has accompanying tests.
  - Run existing tests to verify that your changes do not break any functionality.
  - For hardware-related code contributions, make sure to follow lab testing protocols and provide benchmark results.
  - Use unit tests for isolated functions, and integration tests for interactions between systems.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update documentation as necessary to reflect your changes.
  - Ensure that new features or changes are documented in the relevant sections.
  - The core focus of the documentation is to 'breathe new life into old tech,' so make sure all contributions align with this ethos.

- **Code Reviews:**
  - Review open pull requests and provide constructive feedback.
  - Follow the project's etiquette for code reviews, focusing on readability, maintainability, and scalability.
