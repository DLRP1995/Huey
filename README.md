### Halloween Night Test Results

During Phase 3, we conducted a critical system test on Halloween night, yielding significant insights and accomplishments. This test officially marked the transition from hardware assembly to a full system awakening. Our primary focus during this test was on integrating key components, such as the Supermicro X9QRi-F+ motherboard and the bottom system, ensuring cohesive functionality throughout the entire setup.

The Halloween night test provided an ideal opportunity to evaluate emergency response protocols and overall system resilience under realistic conditions. We implemented and successfully tested emergency cool-off fans powered by a trickle charge source. These fans were designed to activate only during critical moments, such as shutdowns or restarts, ensuring stable cooling under potentially adverse conditions. This setup, combined with the robust internal power supplies, significantly reduced noise levels while maintaining effective thermal management.

Upon powering up, both systems initialized successfully, and diagnostics confirmed effective hardware integration and inter-system communication. We performed detailed optimization of BIOS configurations, adjusted system settings, and ensured that all components were recognized correctly. This foundational work has established a platform for stable and reliable operations moving forward.

The Halloween night test results also highlighted minor areas for improvement, such as fine-tuning liquid cooling pump speeds and refining power distribution during peak loads. These issues will be addressed in subsequent iterations, as we strive for optimized performance. In conclusion, Phase 3 has been an overall success, with the systems now fully awakened and functioning as intended. This milestone has set the stage for the next phase, which will focus on expanding system capabilities, integrating higher-level AI functionalities, and advancing software module development.
