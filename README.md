# Monkey Head Project
Custom A.I. Operating System

## Developer Preview Notice

Welcome to the Developer Preview of the MonkeyHeadProject. This release is an early glimpse into our ambitious endeavor to fuse advanced artificial intelligence with a robust operating system. Please note, this is not a fully operational program but rather a foundational release for developers. It includes infrastructure files, documentation, and an insight into our AI integration within an OS environment.

### What This Preview Includes:
- Basic infrastructure and essential files on GitHub.
- Documentation outlining the project’s vision, AI units’ functionalities, and system capabilities.
- Preliminary code and system architecture details.

### Intended Audience:
- Developers, researchers, and enthusiasts in AI and operating systems.
- Contributors interested in AI mythology and ethical AI development.

We invite you to explore, provide feedback, and contribute to this pioneering phase of the MonkeyHeadProject.

## Overview
The MonkeyHeadProject aims to create an advanced custom AI Operating System. It uniquely combines AI technology with operating system functionalities, offering a futuristic user experience. This project is part of the larger Monkey Head Initiative, integrating AI units inspired by mythological deities into a cohesive system.

## Concepts we implment
- **Adaptive AI Integration**: Incorporates AI units named after mythological figures ('Spark-4', 'Volt-4', 'Zap-4', & 'Watt-4'), each with specialized roles, as detailed in the Federation Constitution documents.
- **Customizable User Experience**: Designed to meet advanced technical requirements, ensuring optimal performance.
- **GENCORE System**: Based on Debian 'Trixie', emphasizing security and versatility.
- **Multi-platform Compatibility**: Functional across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Dynamic System Architecture**: Built on a robust motherboard and powered by Intel Optane Memory, emphasizing speed and efficiency.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Incorporates eco-friendly elements and custom cooling solutions.
- **Open Source Framework**: Community-driven development under GNU GPL V3.
