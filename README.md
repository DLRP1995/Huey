# üß† Monkey Head Project

In this third phase of the MonkeyHead Project, we‚Äôve reached a significant milestone, marking the transition from hardware assembly to system awakening. The focus was on integrating key components, particularly the Supermicro X9QRi-F+ motherboard and the bottom system, ensuring they function cohesively within the setup.

We addressed cooling and power management by incorporating emergency cool-off fans on a trickle charge power source, ensuring they activate only during critical moments, like shutdowns or restarts. This setup, combined with the robust internal power supplies, has reduced noise levels significantly while maintaining efficient cooling.

During the power-up, both systems initialized correctly, confirming effective hardware integration and communication. We addressed BIOS configurations, optimized settings, and ensured component recognition, setting the stage for stable operations.

In conclusion, phase three has been a success, with the systems awakened and running as intended. We‚Äôve laid a solid foundation for the next phase, where we‚Äôll focus on expansion and further development.
