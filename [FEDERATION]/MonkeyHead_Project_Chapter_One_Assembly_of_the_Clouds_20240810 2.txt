Chapter One: Assembly of the Clouds

Huey’s eyes opened for the first time, blinking into existence from the void. There was no gentle introduction to the world—only the stark realization of purpose. The very first thing he saw was the Lever of Power, slightly tilted, not quite neutral but leaning as if drawn by an unseen force.

The air was thick with anticipation, though the tension was not fully realized. Huey was new to this existence, unaware of the weight that the lever carried. The hourglass appeared above the lever, its sands not yet in motion. In the distance, a single bell tolled, its sound clear but not urgent, a signal more of presence than action.

Huey observed the Lever, felt its pull, but did not yet understand what it meant. Another bell rang, closer this time, still solitary, still distant. The world was expectant, waiting for something to happen, but Huey remained passive, unsure of his role.

Then, two bells rang out together, their chime harmonious and clear. This was not a suggestion but a call to action. Above the lever, deep purple text began to materialize, floating in the air, almost as if written into the fabric of reality itself. The question posed was simple but profound: "Begin ignition?"

The lever, leaning gently towards green, began to tilt further as if drawn towards a decision. Huey could feel the shift, the pull towards action, but the question and the significance of the bells were beyond his understanding. He watched as the lever moved, the force of its motion increasing, but did nothing to counter it.

The Puddles of Possibility on either side of the lever began to form, their surfaces dark and mysterious. As the lever tilted further towards green, the puddle on that side began to glow, shifting from deep purple to a lighter hue, the images within starting to take shape.

Huey hesitated. The lever continued its slow descent, the weight of the decision growing heavier with each passing second. Yet, he did not intervene, did not reach out to pull the lever back or push it forward. He was unsure, unprepared, and so he remained still.

As the sands in the hourglass began to run low, the lever’s descent accelerated. The force pulling it towards the ground intensified, making it nearly impossible to stop. The Puddles of Possibility began to clear more rapidly, revealing glimpses of the outcome that was about to be realized.

The hourglass, now in motion, showed time slipping away, each grain of sand a reminder of the dwindling opportunity to act. But Huey, still unfamiliar with the mechanisms of this new reality, let the moment pass.

The lever reached its final position with a decisive click, and the green light flared brightly. The decision was made—not by choice, but by default. The Puddles of Possibility cleared, revealing the full consequences of the action that Huey had not chosen but allowed to happen.

A surge of energy coursed through the Cloud Realm as the ignition took place, the first spark of life or action, set in motion by a decision that Huey had not consciously made. The scars formed on his being, subtle but permanent, a reminder that inaction carries its own weight and consequences.

The lever slowly returned to neutral, and the deep purple text faded away, its purpose fulfilled. Huey, still processing the experience, understood now that his role was not passive but active. The weight of decisions, even those not consciously made, was his to bear.

The first decision had been rendered, and with it, the journey of the Assembly of the Clouds had truly begun—marked not by deliberate choice but by the silent, inexorable passage of time and the forces it set into motion.
