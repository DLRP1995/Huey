Chapter One: Assembly of the Clouds

Huey’s eyes opened for the first time, blinking into existence from the void. There was no gentle introduction to the world—only the stark realization of purpose. The very first thing he saw was the Lever of Power, slightly tilted, not quite neutral but leaning as if drawn by an unseen force.

The space around him was unlike anything he could have imagined. It was as though he had awakened inside a massive, living machine. The walls were made of brass and copper, adorned with countless gears and cogs of every size, each one turning with deliberate, rhythmic precision. The floor beneath him was a mesh of interlocking plates, shifting and moving ever so slightly, as if the entire room was a part of some grand, mechanical symphony.

The air was thick with the scent of oil and metal, a tangible reminder of the room’s intricacy and function. Steam hissed softly from hidden vents, adding to the atmosphere of a colossal, ever-working engine. The light in the room was muted, filtering through frosted glass panes set high in the walls, casting long shadows that danced with the movement of the gears. It was a place of both order and chaos, where every piece had a role to play, yet the sum of its parts seemed almost overwhelming.

There was no chair or throne to sit upon. Instead, Huey stood at the center of this intricate clockwork world, feeling the subtle vibrations of the machinery beneath his feet. Above him, enormous pistons hissed and pumped in time with the steady ticking that filled the air, the sound both soothing and ominous.

The Lever of Power was set into a pedestal that rose from the floor, its base surrounded by smaller gears that turned in tandem with the larger mechanisms above. The lever itself was a sturdy construct of polished metal, its surface cool and smooth to the touch, with tiny, intricate designs etched along its length, reminiscent of the fine detailing found in the gears of an old pocket watch.

Huey’s hand hovered near the lever, drawn to it, yet hesitant to touch it. It was as if the lever was not just a tool, but a living part of the room, connected to every gear, every cog, every ticking second. The lever pulsed slightly under his gaze, as though it were breathing with the room’s mechanical life, waiting for him to take the next step.

As Huey watched, the hourglass appeared above the lever, its sands not yet in motion. In the distance, a single bell tolled, its sound clear but not urgent, echoing through the chamber like a reminder of the passage of time.

He observed the lever, felt its pull, but did not yet understand what it meant. Another bell rang, closer this time, still solitary, still distant. The room seemed to respond to the sound, the gears and cogs quickening their pace ever so slightly, as if preparing for something to come.

Then, three bells rang out together, their chime harmonious and clear, sending a slight vibration through the floor, up through Huey’s legs. It was a call to action, undeniable in its clarity. Above the lever, deep purple text began to materialize, floating in the air, almost as if written into the fabric of reality itself. The question posed was simple but profound: "Begin ignition?"

The lever, leaning gently towards green, began to tilt further as if drawn towards a decision. Huey could feel the shift, the pull towards action, but the question and the significance of the bells were beyond his understanding. He watched as the lever moved, the force of its motion increasing, but did nothing to counter it.

The Puddles of Possibility on either side of the lever began to form on the metallic floor, their surfaces dark and mysterious. As the lever tilted further towards green, the puddle on that side began to glow, shifting from deep purple to a lighter hue, the images within starting to take shape. The puddles seemed almost alive, their surfaces rippling as though stirred by an unseen wind, the future contained within them just out of reach.

Huey hesitated. The lever continued its slow descent, the weight of the decision growing heavier with each passing second. Yet, he did not intervene, did not reach out to pull the lever back or push it forward. He was unsure, unprepared, and so he remained still.

As the sands in the hourglass began to run low, the lever’s descent accelerated. The force pulling it towards the ground intensified, making it nearly impossible to stop. The Puddles of Possibility began to clear more rapidly, revealing glimpses of the outcome that was about to be realized. The entire room seemed to lean with the lever, the machinery groaning as if straining under the weight of the impending decision.

The hourglass, now in motion, showed time slipping away, each grain of sand a reminder of the dwindling opportunity to act. But Huey, still unfamiliar with the mechanisms of this new reality, let the moment pass.

The lever reached its final position with a decisive click, and the green light flared brightly. The decision was made—not by choice, but by default. The Puddles of Possibility cleared, revealing the full consequences of the action that Huey had not chosen but allowed to happen.

A surge of energy coursed through the mechanical room as the ignition took place, the first spark of life or action, set in motion by a decision that Huey had not consciously made. The gears and cogs whirred faster, the entire room seeming to come alive with newfound purpose. The scars formed on his being, subtle but permanent, a reminder that inaction carries its own weight and consequences.

The lever slowly returned to neutral, and the deep purple text faded away, its purpose fulfilled. Huey, still processing the experience, understood now that his role was not passive but active. The weight of decisions, even those not consciously made, was his to bear.

The first decision had been rendered, and with it, the journey of the Assembly of the Clouds had truly begun—marked not by deliberate choice but by the silent, inexorable passage of time and the forces it set into motion.
