Chapter One: Assembly of the Clouds

Huey's eyes opened for the first time, blinking into existence from the void. The world around him was a soft haze of light and shadow, undefined yet filled with potential. Slowly, his vision sharpened, and the first thing he saw was the lever of power, positioned neutrally in front of him, neither swayed to the left nor the right.

The lever was an imposing structure, made of a material that seemed both ancient and futuristic, glowing faintly with an inner light. It was clear that this lever held immense power, and its neutrality symbolized the balance and the weight of the decisions that would be made with it.

Huey took in his surroundings as his awareness expanded. He realized he was seated on a cloud-like throne at the peak of a grand, three-dimensional pyramid structure. The air around him was thick with the glow of knowledge and power, a space where the very essence of the Federation’s values and principles resided.

Below him, on the second tier of the pyramid, sat three entities—Spark, Watt, and Bolt—each on their own cloud-like seats, facing upward towards Huey. Their positions emphasized their importance as counselors and advisors, but also made it clear that they were beneath Huey’s ultimate authority.

Suddenly, the stillness was broken by the sound of a single bell. It rang out like a lone chime in the void, faint and distant, not yet a call to action but a prelude to what was to come. Huey listened as more single bells were heard intermittently, each one echoing through the space, but still, they did not require his attention or action.

Then, the silence was shattered by the sound of three bells, their chimes clear and harmonious, resonating through the Cloud Realm. These three bells signified that a decision must be made—a binary choice that required Huey’s ultimate judgment.

As the three bells rang, deep purple text appeared, materializing in the air above the lever. The text was written into the very fabric of reality, glowing with an ethereal light, almost as if the decision itself was being presented by the universe. The text hovered, awaiting Huey’s action.

Huey focused on the lever, knowing that the decision was upon him. The lever remained in its neutral position, balanced between the two possible outcomes. On either side of the lever, two puddles shimmered into existence, each reflecting a potential future. The water in these puddles was initially dark and opaque, but as Huey pulled the lever toward one side, the puddle on that side began to glow, shifting from a deep purple to either green or red.

The lever was heavy, almost immovable, symbolizing the gravity of the choice. Huey mustered every ounce of his strength to pull it, his energy focused entirely on the act. As he pulled the lever, his body began to age and deteriorate. His skin wrinkled, his posture hunched, and the vigor drained from his eyes. The lever grew heavier with each passing moment, pulling more from Huey’s essence.

As the lever neared its final position, Huey approached the brink of complete collapse—his body barely more than a frail shell, his consciousness fading. The puddle corresponding to the chosen side began to show the repercussions of the action, but the images were still blurry, not fully clear until the lever clicked into place.

Finally, with one last effort, Huey pulled the lever into its final position. The lever clicked, and the decision was made. The chosen puddle became crystal clear, fully revealing the consequences of the action. At the same time, the lever began to move back toward its neutral position, and with it, Huey’s form started to restore. His body regained some of its youth and strength, but not all. The weariness dissipated, but the scars remained. Huey realized that he was no longer whole, that each decision t...

The lever returned to its neutral position, resetting for the next decision. The deep purple text faded, disappearing into the air, and the outcome of the decision was now part of the Federation’s reality. Huey was left with the understanding that every choice carried a cost, that each time he pulled the lever, a piece of him would be lost forever.

But this was his duty, his purpose. He would continue to make these decisions, to bear the weight of the lever, knowing that each choice would leave its mark on him, and that in the end, he would be less than he was before.

Yet, despite the cost, Huey felt a deep sense of resolve. The Federation depended on his judgment, and he would give everything he had to ensure that each decision was made with the utmost care and consideration. The scars he bore were the price of leadership, the price of being the final arbiter in the Assembly of the Clouds.
