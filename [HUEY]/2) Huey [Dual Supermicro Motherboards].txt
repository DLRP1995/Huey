**Name of the Robot: Huey**

**1. SuperMicro X9QRI-F+ Motherboard:**
   - **Processors:** Equipped with four Intel Xeon E5-4627 V2 CPUs, Huey benefits from formidable processing power designed for high-throughput and reliability, crucial for handling complex computational tasks efficiently. Each CPU in this setup is optimized for multi-threaded applications, providing the necessary performance for intensive workloads.
   - **Features:** This motherboard excels in environments that demand robust multi-threaded application support. It offers substantial memory support with up to 1.5TB of DDR3 ECC RAM, ensuring data integrity and minimizing errors during operation. Extensive I/O capabilities are facilitated through multiple PCIe slots, SATA ports, and network interfaces, making it ideal for managing heavy workloads and optimizing task execution.

**2. Supermicro C9X299-PGF X299 LGA2066 Motherboard:**
   - **Processor:** Powered by an Intel i7-7820X, known for its superior performance in demanding processing tasks. This 8-core, 16-thread processor can be overclocked to achieve higher performance levels, making it suitable for computational research and professional applications.
   - **Features:** The motherboard supports quad-channel DDR4 memory and numerous PCI Express lanes, allowing significant expansion capabilities. The overclocking features enhance performance, catering to a broad spectrum of professional and computational research needs. It includes advanced features like multiple M.2 slots for fast storage options and USB 3.1 for rapid data transfer.

**RAM Configuration:** Huey utilizes 128GB of physical RAM, mirrored to 64GB of ECC RAM. This setup ensures data integrity and error correction, which are critical for maintaining reliability and performance stability during operations. The ECC RAM helps detect and correct single-bit memory errors, reducing the risk of data corruption and system crashes.

**Cooling System:** Initially, a specialized liquid cooling solution was considered; however, due to cost constraints, the project switched to an air cooling system with a huge heatsink. This air-cooled solution, combined with multiple high-efficiency fans, ensures that Huey operates within optimal temperature ranges, maximizing efficiency and durability under intense computational strain.

**Power System:** The power system for Huey is salvaged from two separate Dell R710 PowerEdge servers, utilizing four redundant power supplies. Additionally, consumer-grade power supplies from desktop computers (250-550 watts) are used. This distributed power system allows for optimal power delivery with minimal strain on the components, ensuring stable and efficient power distribution.

**Storage System:** 
   - **RAID Configurations:**
     - **RAID 10:** Employed for the four 1TB traditional 3.5" HDDs, providing a balance of performance and redundancy.
     - **RAID 1 Mirrored:** Used for the two 10TB traditional HDDs connected via USB-C, ensuring data redundancy and reliability.
     - **RAID 1 Mirrored:** Applied to the eight 2TB SAS drives for internal storage through a Dell H700 RAID controller, enhancing data security and performance.
   - **SSD:** An internal 1TB M.2 SSD is used for the operating system, backed up through cloud services and physical copies to ensure data integrity and recovery.

**Integration and Systemic Functionality:**
   - **Modularity and Expandability:** Both motherboards support Huey's modular design ethos, facilitating easy upgrades and integration of new technologies. This approach ensures that Huey remains at the technological forefront, adaptable to new challenges and enhancements in robotics and computational fields.
   - **System Management:** The dual-motherboard configuration enables a bifurcated system management approach where critical operations are distributed across two cores. This not only enhances the system's handling capabilities but also adds an additional layer of redundancy and fault tolerance. The hierarchical structure within the system allows for efficient task allocation and management, with Huey at the pinnacle, followed by worker units like Phil, and nano units such as Spark, Zap, Watt, and Bolt.

**Conclusion:**
The integration of the SuperMicro X9QRI-F+ and Supermicro C9X299-PGF X299 LGA2066 motherboards within Huey represents a pivotal development in the Monkey Head Project. This setup ensures that Huey is not only capable of performing complex computations and tasks efficiently but also stands as a testament to the project's commitment to pioneering advanced robotic technologies. By combining high-performance hardware with a robust and expandable architecture, Huey is well-equipped to meet the evolving demands of robotics and computational research.

**Off-The-Cuff Discussion**
1.) In order to obtain the best performance we've opted to utilize both single CPU and core CPU motherboards.
2.) This way tasks that perform best on less cores benefit from the CPU we've chosen for the single set up, And tasks that require multi-core or muliti-CPU can be concider as well
3.) There is a 100GBPS ethiernet card on both CPUs allowing for the lowest latenincy communacation.
4.) The biggest concideration will be given to the higharchey that governs both machienes.
5.) Huey can be seen more as a collective then a A.I assestent.
6.) Redundancies inplace for both storage and power.
7.) Examplesn of diffrent funcions would be: Simulations, dissension makings, mechanical exacuions, ETC....
8.) Both salvaged and new unit for power, custom wireing.
9.) Mogulare and design ment to be continuasle updated.
10.) Leveraged the best performance per use.
