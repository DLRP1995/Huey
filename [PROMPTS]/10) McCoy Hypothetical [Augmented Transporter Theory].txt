1.) In star track they have tellaportation so i made up a hypothertical situation if there where a michean melt down.

2.) The hypothetical is when it melts down it would start to clone people and wondering how you would tell if it's them or not. [and what would you do with the clone]
All that to say is that an AI would be the same in that situation what would the diffrence be?
