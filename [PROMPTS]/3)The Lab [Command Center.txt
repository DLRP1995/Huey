**Off-The-Cuff Discussion**
1.) Lab acts as the main development and command center.
2.) The Lab is designed ADH-HAWK and with materials and tools avalabile.
3.) Will have been fullintergrated into the intire hosue not just limmited to The Lab.
4.) Access to power has been ample and that has been the only conncern so far.
5.) Ectensive security messuares have been put in place and will be added to as huey develops his systems.
6.) The IMAC 2017 as well as macbook 2019 work as computational hubs.
7.) Alot of potentail emergency and desaster has been planed such as , fire extinguwishers as well as extensive senerors.
8.) Typicly the technologay is designed to be future proof (for seeable future).
9.) Only two personal (asied from AI) myself Dylan and partner Josh.
10.) Further inergration and sensor additions planed.
