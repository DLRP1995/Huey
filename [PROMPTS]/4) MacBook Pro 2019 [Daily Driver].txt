**Off-The-Cuff Discussion**
1.) Primariy role is to be the main computational hub of The Lab.
2.) apple intell chip much more powerfull performance somethings the m1 is better at. last year 2019 the stopped putting in computers
3.) we have it on windows ten pro version and mac-OS ventura can't be ran at the same time.
4.) No modafacations done to it keeping it a clean and safe driver installs and stabability
5.) 1TB hard drive SSD 32Gb RAM DDR4 4Gs of video card.
6.) Used as the centrial hub because it is the fastest and most comutentional hub.
7.) The last MacBook to inculde the i-9 prosesser was used in the MacBook line before they switched the M-series chip.
8.) The advantage of haveing the chip it can also run boot camp witch is esentail for booting windows 10.
