Plugins
=======

The application can be enhanced with plugins to add new features.

The following plugins are currently available, and GPT can use them instantly:

* ``Command: Google Web Search`` - allows searching the internet via the `Google Custom Search Engine`.
* ``Command: Files I/O`` - grants access to the local filesystem, enabling GPT to read and write files, as well as list and create directories.
* ``Command: Code Interpreter`` - responsible for generating and executing Python code, functioning much like the `Code Interpreter` on `ChatGPT`, but locally. This means GPT can interface with any script, application, or code. The plugin can also execute system commands, allowing GPT to integrate with your operating system. Plugins can work in conjunction to perform sequential tasks; for example, the `Files` plugin can write generated Python code to a file, which the `Code Interpreter` can execute it and return its result to GPT.
* ``Command: Custom Commands`` - allows you to create and execute custom commands on your system.
* ``Audio Output (Microsoft Azure)`` - provides voice synthesis using the Microsoft Azure Text To Speech API.
* ``Audio Output (OpenAI TTS)`` - provides voice synthesis using the `OpenAI Text To Speech API`.
* ``Audio Input (OpenAI Whisper)`` - offers speech recognition through the `OpenAI Whisper API`.
* ``Self Loop`` - creates a self-loop mode, where GPT can generate a continuous conversation between two AI instances, effectively talking to itself.
* ``Real Time`` - automatically adds the current date and time to prompts, informing the model of the real-time moment.


Command: Files I/O
-----------------

The plugin allows for file management within the local filesystem. It enables the model to create, read, and write files and directories located in the `output` directory, which can be found in the user's work directory. With this plugin, the AI can also generate Python code files and thereafter execute that code within the user's system.

Plugin capabilities include:

* Reading files
* Appending to files
* Writing files
* Deleting files and directories
* Listing files and directories
* Creating directories
* Downloading files
* Copying files and directories
* Moving (renaming) files and directories

If a file being created (with the same name) already exists, a prefix including the date and time is added to the file name.

**Options:**

- ``Enable: Read file`` *cmd_read_file*

Allows `read_file` command. *Default:* `True`

- ``Enable: Append to file`` *cmd_append_file*

Allows `append_file` command. *Default:* `True`

Allows `file_size` command. *Default:* `True`

- ``Enable: Get file info`` *cmd_file_info*

Allows `file_info` command. *Default:* `True`


Command: Code Interpreter
-------------------------

**Executing Code**

The plugin operates similarly to the ``Code Interpreter`` in ``ChatGPT``, with the key difference that it works locally on the user's system. It allows for the execution of any Python code on the computer that the model may generate. When combined with the ``Command: Files I/O`` plugin, it facilitates running code from files saved in the ``output`` directory. You can also prepare your own code files and enable the model to use them or add your own plugin for this purpose. You can execute commands and code on the host machine or in Docker container.

**Executing system commands**

Another feature is the ability to execute system commands and return their results. With this functionality, the plugin can run any system command, retrieve the output, and then feed the result back to the model. When used with other features, this provides extensive integration capabilities with the system.

**Options:**

- ``Python command template`` *python_cmd_tpl*

Python command template (use {filename} as path to file placeholder). *Default:* ``python3 {filename}``

- ``Enable: Python Code Generate and Execute`` *cmd_code_execute*

Allows Python code execution (generate and execute from file). *Default:* `True`

- ``Enable: Python Code Execute (File)`` *cmd_code_execute_file*

Allows Python code execution from existing file. *Default:* `True`
 
- ``Enable: System Command Execute`` *cmd_sys_exec*

Allows system commands execution. *Default:* `True`

- ``Sandbox (docker container)`` *sandbox_docker*

Executes commands in sandbox (docker container). Docker must be installed and running. *Default:* ``False``

- ``Docker image`` *sandbox_docker_image*

Docker image to use for sandbox *Default:* ``python:3.8-alpine``


Command: Custom Commands
------------------------

With the ``Custom Commands`` plugin, you can integrate **PyGPT** with your operating system and scripts or applications. You can define an unlimited number of custom commands and instruct GPT on when and how to execute them. Configuration is straightforward, and **PyGPT** includes a simple tutorial command for testing and learning how it works:

.. image:: images/v2_custom_cmd.png
   :width: 800

To add a new custom command, click the **ADD** button and then:

1. Provide a name for your command: this is a unique identifier for GPT.
2. Provide an ``instruction`` explaining what this command does; GPT will know when to use the command based on this instruction.
3. Define ``params``, separated by commas - GPT will send data to your commands using these params. These params will be placed into placeholders you have defined in the ``cmd`` field. For example:

If you want instruct GPT to execute your Python script named ``smart_home_lights.py`` with an argument, such as ``1`` to turn the light ON, and ``0`` to turn it OFF, define it as follows:

- **name**: lights_cmd
- **instruction**: turn lights on/off; use 1 as 'arg' to turn ON, or 0 as 'arg' to turn OFF
- **params**: arg
- **cmd**: ``python /path/to/smart_home_lights.py {arg}``

The setup defined above will work as follows:

When you ask GPT to turn your lights ON, GPT will locate this command and prepare the command ``python /path/to/smart_home_lights.py {arg}`` with ``{arg}`` replaced with ``1``. On your system, it will execute the command:

.. code-block:: console

  python /path/to/smart_home_lights.py 1

And that's all. GPT will take care of the rest when you ask to turn ON the lights.

You can define as many placeholders and parameters as you desire.

Here are some predefined system placeholders for use:

- ``{_time}`` - current time in ``H:M:S`` format
- ``{_date}`` - current date in ``Y-m-d`` format
- ``{_datetime}`` - current date and time in ``Y-m-d H:M:S`` format
- ``{_file}`` - path to the file from which the command is invoked
- ``{_home}`` - path to PyGPT's home/working directory

You can connect predefined placeholders with your own params.

*Example:*

- **name**: song_cmd
- **instruction**: store the generated song on hard disk
- **params**: song_text, title
- **cmd**: ``echo "{song_text}" > {_home}/{title}.txt``

With the setup above, every time you ask GPT to generate a song for you and save it to the disk, it will:

1. Generate a song.
2. Locate your command.
3. Execute the command by sending the song's title and text.
4. The command will save the song text into a file named with the song's title in the **PyGPT** working directory.

**Example tutorial command**

**PyGPT** provides simple tutorial command to show how it work, to run it just ask GPT for execute ``tutorial test command`` and it will show you how it works:

.. code-block:: console

  > please execute tutorial test command

.. image:: images/v2_custom_cmd_example.png

Command: Google Web Search
--------------------------

**PyGPT** lets you connect GPT to the internet and carry out web searches in real time as you make queries.

To activate this feature, turn on the ``Command: Google Web Search`` plugin found in the ``Plugins`` menu.

Web searches are automated through the ``Google Custom Search Engine`` API. 
To use this feature, you need an API key, which you can obtain by registering an account at:

https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview

After registering an account, create a new project and select it from the list of available projects:

https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all

After selecting your project, you need to enable the ``Whole Internet Search`` option in its settings. 
Then, copy the following two items into **PyGPT**:

* Api Key
* CX ID

These data must be configured in the appropriate fields in the ``Plugins / Settings...`` menu:

.. image:: images/v2_plugin_google.png
   :width: 600


Audio Output (Microsoft Azure)
--------------------------

**PyGPT** implements voice synthesis using the ``Microsoft Azure Text-To-Speech`` API.
This feature requires to have an ``Microsoft Azure`` API Key. 
You can get API KEY for free from here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech


To enable voice synthesis, activate the ``Audio Output (Microsoft Azure)`` plugin in the ``Plugins`` menu or 
turn on the ``Voice`` option in the ``Audio / Voice`` menu (both options in the menu achieve the same outcome).

Before using speech synthesis, you must configure the audio plugin with your Azure API key and the correct 
Region in the settings.

This is done through the ``Plugins / Settings...`` menu by selecting the `Audio (Azure)` tab:

.. image:: images/v2_azure.png
   :width: 600

**Options:**

``Azure API Key`` *azure_api_key*

Here, you should enter the API key, which can be obtained by registering for free on the following website: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech

``Azure Region`` *azure_region*

You must also provide the appropriate region for Azure here. *Default:* `eastus`

``Voice (EN)`` *voice_en*

Here you can specify the name of the voice used for speech synthesis for English. *Default:* `en-US-AriaNeural`


``Voice (PL)`` *voice_pl*

Here you can specify the name of the voice used for speech synthesis for the Polish language. *Default:* `pl-PL-AgnieszkaNeural`

If speech synthesis is enabled, a voice will be additionally generated in the background while generating a response via GPT.

Both ``OpenAI TTS`` and ``OpenAI Whisper`` use the same single API key provided for the OpenAI API, with no additional keys required.


Audio Output (OpenAI TTS)
--------------------------

The plugin enables voice synthesis using the TTS model developed by OpenAI. Using this plugin does not require any additional API keys or extra configuration; it utilizes the main OpenAI key. Through the available options, you can select the voice that you want the model to use.

``Model`` *model*

Choose the model. Available options:

* tts-1
* tts-1-hd

*Default:* `tts-1`

``Voice`` *voice*

Choose the voice. Available voices to choose from:

* alloy
* echo
* fable
* onyx
* nova
* shimmer

*Default:* `alloy`

Audio Input (OpenAI Whisper)
----------------------------

The plugin facilitates speech recognition using the ``Whisper`` model by OpenAI. It allows for voice commands to be relayed to the AI using your own voice. The plugin doesn't require any extra API keys or additional configurations; it uses the main OpenAI key. In the plugin's configuration options, you should adjust the volume level (min energy) at which the plugin will respond to your microphone. Once the plugin is activated, a new ``Speak`` option will appear at the bottom near the ``Send`` button  -  when this is enabled, the application will respond to the voice received from the microphone.

Configuration options:

``Model`` *model*

Choose the model. *Default:* `whisper-1`

``Timeout`` *timeout*

The duration in seconds that the application waits for voice input from the microphone. *Default:* `2`

``Phrase max length`` *phrase_length*

Minimum threshold multiplier above the noise level to begin recording. *Default:* `1.3`

``Adjust for ambient noise`` *adjust_noise*

Enables adjustment to ambient noise levels. *Default:* `True`

``Continuous listen`` *continuous_listen*

EXPERIMENTAL: continuous listening - do not stop listening after a single input. Warning: This feature may lead to unexpected results and requires fine-tuning with the rest of the options! If disabled, listening must be started manually by enabling the ``Speak`` option. *Default:* `False`

- ``Auto send`` *auto_send*

Automatically send recognized speech as input text after recognition.. *Default:* `True`

- ``Wait for response`` *wait_response*

Wait for a response before initiating listening for the next input. *Default:* `True`

- ``Magic word`` *magic_word*

Activate listening only after the magic word is provided. *Default:* `False`

- ``Reset Magic word`` *magic_word_reset*

Reset the magic word status after it is received (the magic word will need to be provided again). *Default:* `True`

- ``Magic words`` *magic_words*

List of magic words to initiate listening (Magic word mode must be enabled). *Default:* `OK, Okay, Hey GPT, OK GPT`

- ``Magic word timeout`` *magic_word_timeout*

he number of seconds the application waits for magic word. *Default:* `1`

- ``Magic word phrase max length`` *magic_word_phrase_length*

The minimum phrase duration for magic word. *Default:* `2`

- ``Prefix words`` *prefix_words*

List of words that must initiate each phrase to be processed. For example, you can define words like "OK" or "GPT"—if set, any phrases not starting with those words will be ignored. Insert multiple words or phrases separated by commas. Leave empty to deactivate.  *Default:* `empty`

- ``Stop words`` *stop_words*

List of words that will stop the listening process. *Default:* `stop, exit, quit, end, finish, close, terminate, kill, halt, abort`

**Advanced options**

- ``energy_threshold`` *recognition_energy_threshold*

Represents the energy level threshold for sounds. *Default:* `300`

- ``dynamic_energy_threshold`` *recognition_dynamic_energy_threshold*

Represents whether the energy level threshold (see recognizer_instance.energy_threshold) for sounds should be automatically adjusted based on the currently ambient noise level while listening. *Default:* `True`

- ``dynamic_energy_adjustment_damping`` *recognition_dynamic_energy_adjustment_damping*

Represents approximately the fraction of the current energy threshold that is retained after one second of dynamic threshold adjustment. *Default:* `0.15`

- ``pause_threshold`` *recognition_pause_threshold*

Represents the minimum length of silence (in seconds) that will register as the end of a phrase. *Default:* `0.8`

- ``adjust_for_ambient_noise: duration`` *recognition_adjust_for_ambient_noise_duration*

The duration parameter is the maximum number of seconds that it will dynamically adjust the threshold for before returning. *Default:* `1`

Options reference: https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/1.3.1/


Self Loop
----------

The plugin introduces a "talk with yourself" mode, where GPT begins a conversation with itself. 
You can set this loop to run for any number of iterations. Throughout such a sequence, the model will engage 
in self-dialogue, responding to its own questions and comments. This feature is available in both ``Chat`` and ``Completion`` modes. 
To enhance the experience in Completion mode, you can assign specific names (roles) to each participant in the dialogue.

To effectively start this mode, it's important to craft the system prompt carefully, ensuring it indicates to GPT that 
it is conversing with itself. The outcomes can be intriguing, so it's worth exploring what happens when you try this.

You can adjust the number of iterations for the self-conversation in the ``Plugins / Settings...`` menu under the following option:

``Iterations`` *iterations*

*Default:* `3`


**Additional options:**

``Clear context output`` *clear_output*


The option clears the previous answer in the context, which is then used as input for the next iteration. *Default:* `True`


``Reverse roles between iterations`` *reverse_roles*

If enabled, this option reverses the roles (AI <> user) with each iteration. For example, 
if in the previous iteration the response was generated for "Batman," the next iteration will use that 
response to generate an input for "Joker." *Default:* `True`


Real Time
----------

This plugin automatically adds the current date and time to each system prompt you send. 
You have the option to include just the date, just the time, or both.

When enabled, it quietly enhances each system prompt with current time information before sending it to GPT.

**Options**

``Append time`` *hour*

If enabled, it appends the current time to the system prompt. *Default:* `True`

``Append date`` *date*

If enabled, it appends the current date to the system prompt. *Default:* `True` 

``Template`` *tpl*

Template to append to the system prompt. The placeholder ``{time}`` will be replaced with the 
current date and time in real-time. *Default:* `Current time is {time}.`

Creating Your Own Plugins
--------------------------

You can create your own plugin for **PyGPT** at any time. The plugin can be written in Python and then registered with the application just before launching it. All plugins included with the app are stored in the ``plugin`` directory - you can use them as coding examples for your own plugins.

Extending PyGPT with custom plugins and LLMs wrappers:

- You can pass custom plugin instances and LLMs wrappers to the launcher.

- This is useful if you want to extend PyGPT with your own plugins and LLMs.

To register custom plugins:

- Pass a list with the plugin instances as the first argument.

To register custom LLMs wrappers:

- Pass a list with the LLMs wrappers instances as the second argument.

**Example:**


.. code-block:: python

   # my_launcher.py

   from pygpt_net.app import run
   from my_plugins import MyCustomPlugin, MyOtherCustomPlugin
   from my_llms import MyCustomLLM

   plugins = [
       MyCustomPlugin(),
       MyOtherCustomPlugin(),
   ]
   llms = [
       MyCustomLLM(),
   ]

   run(plugins, llms)  # <-- plugins as the first argument

## Handling events

In the plugin, you can receive and modify dispatched events.
To do this, create a method named ``handle(self, event, *args, **kwargs)`` and handle the received events like here:

.. code-block:: python

   # my_plugin.py

   def handle(self, event, *args, **kwargs):
       """
       Handle dispatched events

       :param event: event object
       """
       name = event.name
       data = event.data
       ctx = event.ctx

       if name == 'input.before':
           self.some_method(data['value'])
       elif name == 'ctx.begin':
           self.some_other_method(ctx)
       else:
           # ...

**List of Events**

Syntax: **event name** - triggered on, ``event data`` `(data type)`:

- **ai.name** - when preparing an AI name, ``data['value']`` `(string, name of the AI assistant)`

- **audio.input.toggle** - when speech input is enabled or disabled, ``data['value']`` `(bool, True/False)`

- **cmd.execute** - when a command is executed, ``data['commands']`` `(list, commands and arguments)`

- **cmd.syntax** - when appending syntax for commands, ``data['prompt'], data['syntax']`` `(string, list, prompt and list with commands usage syntax)`

- **ctx.after** - after the context item is sent, ``ctx``

- **ctx.before** - before the context item is sent, ``ctx``

- **ctx.begin** - when context item create, ``ctx``

- **ctx.end** - when context handling is finished, ``ctx``

- **disable** - when the plugin is disabled, ``data['value']`` `(string, plugin ID)`

- **enable** - when the plugin is enabled, ``data['value']`` `(string, plugin ID)`

- **input.before** - upon receiving input from the textarea, ``data['value']`` `(string, text to be sent)`

- **system.prompt** - when preparing a system prompt, ``data['value']`` `(string, system prompt)`

- **user.name** - when preparing a user's name, ``data['value']`` `(string, name of the user)`

- **user.send** - just before the input text is sent, ``data['value']`` `(string, input text)`


You can stop the propagation of a received event at any time by setting ``stop`` to ``True``:

.. code-block:: python

   event.stop = True
