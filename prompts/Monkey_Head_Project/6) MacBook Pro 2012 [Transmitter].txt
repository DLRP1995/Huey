**Off-The-Cuff Discussion**
1.) This one also runs Duial booted windows 11 pr for work stations witch also helps run debby and trixy
2.) Majour motofacations done and more required starting with removing the CD Drive and adding a custom hard-drive caddy.
3.) Sound system yet to be fixed soloution may be internal USB addapter.
4.) Battery replacement yet to be done.
5.) RAMGB upped to 16GB DDR3-RAM.
6.) Dual hard-drive 1 configured to eatch OS.
