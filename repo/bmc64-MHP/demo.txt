# This is a demo mode script for setting up an
# interactive Commodore 64 kiosk.  It instructs
# BMC64 to cycle through a set of snapshots with
# a specified timeout for each one. You can chose
# whether user input (joystick/keyboard) will reset
# the timeout or not. You can also indicate joystick
# ports should be swapped for some games that require
# different ports from that of startup settings.

# The format is:
# [operation],[file],[timeout],[mode],[joyswap],
#
# (note the last , is required)

# where:
# [operation] is one of:
#    r = reset to basic
#    s = snapshot
#    d = diskswap
#    c = cartridge
#    dc = detach cartridge (causes reset)
#    dd = detach disk
#
# [timeout] is the timeout in seconds
# [mode] is one of:
#    i = timeout will be reset by any user activity
#    n = timeout will not be reset by user activity
# [joyswap] is one of:
#    1 = joy port assignments swapped from saved settings
#    0 = joy port assignments not swapped
