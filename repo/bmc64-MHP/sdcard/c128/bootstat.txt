# This file tells stdio glue code to fast fail, fast stat certain files
# that are accessed at boot time in order to speed up the boot process.
# If this file is missing, the default internal list will be used which
# matches the checked in version.
#
# Note: Any unqualified filename will fake success or fail for the file
# regardless of the directory it resides in. Machine kernal and character
# roms you know are present can have a 'stat' entry here. Any files you want
# to fail regardless of where they reside can have a 'fail' entry. If you
# want to store your drive rom files in DRIVES, you can add fail entries
# for /C128/filename to speed up boot slightly since VICE looks for those
# files first in the machine specific dir.  But this is not necessary.
