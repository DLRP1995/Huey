Advanced configuration
======================

Manual configuration
---------------------
You can manually edit the configuration files in this directory:

.. code-block:: ini

   {HOME_DIR}/.config/pygpt-net/

* ``assistants.json`` - contains the list of assistants.
* ``attachments.json`` - keeps track of the current attachments.
* ``config.json`` - holds the main configuration settings.
* ``models.json`` - stores models configurations.
* ``context.json`` - maintains an index of contexts.
* ``context`` - a directory for context files in `.json` format.
* ``capture`` - a directory for captured images from camera
* ``history`` - a directory for history logs in `.txt` format.
* ``img`` - a directory for images generated with `DALL-E 3` and `DALL-E 2`, saved as `.png` files.
* ``output`` - a directory for output files and files downloaded/generated by GPT.
* ``presets`` - a directory for presets stored as `.json` files.


Translations / locale
-----------------------
Locale `.ini` files are located in the directory:

.. code-block:: ini

   ./data/locale


This directory is automatically scanned when the application launches. To add a new translation, 
create and save the file with the appropriate name, for example:

.. code-block:: ini

   locale.es.ini  


This will add Spanish as a selectable language in the application's language menu.

**Overwriting with your own files:**

You can also overwrite files in the ``locale`` and ``css`` app directories with your own files in the user directory. 
This allows you to overwrite language files or CSS styles in a very simple way - by just creating files in your working directory.


.. code-block:: ini

   {HOME_DIR}/.config/pygpt-net/

   - `locale` - a directory for locales in `.ini` format.
   - `css` - a directory for css styles
