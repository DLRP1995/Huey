Advanced configuration
======================

Manual configuration
---------------------
You can manually edit the configuration files in this directory (this is your work directory):

.. code-block:: ini

   {HOME_DIR}/.config/pygpt-net/

* ``assistants.json`` - stores the list of assistants.
* ``attachments.json`` - stores the list of current attachments.
* ``config.json`` - stores the main configuration settings.
* ``models.json`` - stores models configurations.
* ``cache`` - a directory for audio cache.
* ``capture`` - a directory for captured images from camera and screenshots
* ``css`` - a directory for CSS stylesheets (user override)
* ``history`` - a directory for context history in ``.txt`` format.
* ``idx`` - ``Llama-index`` indexes
* ``img`` - a directory for images generated with ``DALL-E 3`` and ``DALL-E 2``, saved as ``.png`` files.
* ``locale`` - a directory for locales (user override)
* ``data`` - a directory for data files and files downloaded/generated by GPT.
* ``presets`` - a directory for presets stored as ``.json`` files.
* ``upload`` - a directory for local copies of attachments coming from outside the workdir
* ``db.sqlite`` - a database with contexts, notepads and indexes data records
* ``app.log`` - a file with error and debug log


Translations / locale
-----------------------
Locale `.ini` files are located in the directory:

.. code-block:: ini

   ./data/locale


This directory is automatically scanned when the application launches. To add a new translation, 
create and save the file with the appropriate name, for example:

.. code-block:: ini

   locale.es.ini  


This will add Spanish as a selectable language in the application's language menu.

**Overwriting CSS and locales with Your Own Files:**

You can also overwrite files in the ``locale`` and ``css`` app directories with your own files in the user directory. 
This allows you to overwrite language files or CSS styles in a very simple way - by just creating files in your working directory.


.. code-block:: ini

   {HOME_DIR}/.config/pygpt-net/


* `locale` - a directory for locales in ``.ini`` format.
* `css` - a directory for CSS styles

**Adding Your Own Fonts**

You can add your own fonts and use them in CSS files. To load your own fonts, you should place them in the ``%workdir%/fonts`` directory. Supported font types include: ``otf``, ``ttf``.
You can see the list of loaded fonts in ``Debug / Config``.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: ini

   %workdir%
   |_css
   |_data
   |_fonts
      |_MyFont
        |_MyFont-Regular.ttf
        |_MyFont-Bold.ttf
        |...
        

.. code-block:: css

   pre {{
       font-family: 'MyFont';
   }}
