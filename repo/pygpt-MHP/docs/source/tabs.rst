Notepad
===========

The application has a built-in notepad, divided into several tabs. This can be useful for storing information in a convenient way, without the need to open an external text editor. The content of the notepad is automatically saved whenever the content changes.

Draw (paint)
=============

Using the ``Draw`` tool, you can create quick sketches and submit them to the model for analysis. You can also edit open or camera-captured images, for example, by adding elements like arrows or outlines to objects. Additionally, you can capture screenshots from the system - the captured image is placed in the drawing tool and attached to the query being sent.

Using the calendar, you can go back to selected conversations from a specific day and add daily notes. After adding a note, it will be marked on the list, and you can change the color of its label by right-clicking and selecting ``Set label color`` option. By clicking on a particular day of the week, conversations from that day will be displayed.
