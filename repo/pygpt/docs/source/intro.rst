Introduction
=============

Overview
----------------

**PyGPT** is **all-in-one** Desktop AI Assistant that provides direct interaction with OpenAI language models, including ``GPT-4``, ``GPT-4 Vision``, and ``GPT-3.5``, through the ``OpenAI API``. By utilizing ``Langchain`` and ``Llama-index``, the application also supports alternative LLMs, like those available on ``HuggingFace``, locally available models (like ``Llama 3`` or ``Mistral``), ``Google Gemini`` and ``Anthropic Claude``.

This assistant offers multiple modes of operation such as chat, assistants, completions, and image-related tasks using ``DALL-E 3`` for generation and ``GPT-4 Vision`` for image analysis. **PyGPT** has filesystem capabilities for file I/O, can generate and run Python code, execute system commands, and manage file transfers. It also allows models to perform web searches with the ``Google`` and ``Microsoft Bing``.

For audio interactions, **PyGPT** includes speech synthesis using the ``Microsoft Azure``, ``Google``, ``Eleven Labs`` and ``OpenAI`` Text-To-Speech services. Additionally, it features speech recognition capabilities provided by ``OpenAI Whisper``, ``Google`` and ``Bing``, enabling the application to understand spoken commands and transcribe audio inputs into text. It features context memory with save and load functionality, enabling users to resume interactions from predefined points in the conversation. Prompt creation and management are streamlined through an intuitive preset system.

**PyGPT**'s functionality extends through plugin support, allowing for custom enhancements. Its multi-modal capabilities make it an adaptable tool for a range of AI-assisted operations, such as text-based interactions, system automation, daily assisting, vision applications, natural language processing, code generation and image creation.

Multiple operation modes are included, such as chatbot, text completion, assistant, vision, Langchain, Chat with files (via ``Llama-index``), commands execution, external API calls and image generation, making **PyGPT** a multi-tool for many AI-driven tasks.
